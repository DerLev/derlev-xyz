# About this website

## Scope

The scope of this website is to give little and useful code snippets a place on 
the internet. I personally struggle to finde certain very specific things, so 
I thought I might at least post them somewhere when I eventually find the 
answer.  
This website also serves as my personal dev diary. Those posts might come in 
handy if you stumble upon a problem in web development that I might have solved 
and written about or if you just want to know what I am doing or how I did 
certain things.

## Tech stack

This website is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for SSG, 
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and 
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [React](https://react.dev/) for custom 
Web Components (e.g. Nav loader, "copy code" button). All hosted on 
[Google's Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). You can always look at the 
code yourself and fix typos or factual errors in the 
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DerLev/derlev-xyz/).
